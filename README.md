## Brief description of Project
### Water is not just a word, it supports our life, and it is an invaluable commodity. The project is a bold step save and reuse water.

These days, water is being wasted in public places, offices, and even households. According to NITI Aayog Water Management Index Report 2018, the worst water crisis in India's history is currently underway.

The solution is straightforward: A specific, lightweight item that fits beneath the washbasin easily in place of conventional drain pipe in hospital washrooms, household facilities, public restrooms, hotel utilities and corporate lavatories where sensors powered with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology would determine which water could be reused in other activities like watering plants, flushing amongst many purposes leading to conserving water.
